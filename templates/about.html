<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770.
            While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in
            the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
            Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground
            as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.[2]

            Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the
            dungeons of Dol Guldur.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Oin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin.

            Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
            company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
            reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost

        <h3>Dwalin</h3>
        <p>
            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied
            Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

            Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the
            Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845,
            Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black
            rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the
            news.
